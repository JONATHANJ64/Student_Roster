Merge Conflict Resolution:
In Step E of the guide, a merge conflict was encountered when attempting to merge the readme branch into the main branch. To resolve the 
conflict, the following steps were taken:

Used the vi text editor to open the conflicting README.md file in the main branch.
Reviewed the conflicting sections (indicated by <<<<<<< HEAD and >>>>>>> readme markers) and made the necessary edits to fix the conflict.
Specifically, corrected the student ID and kept the git version line as desired.
When I did this I was corrected with an error from not pulling the latest changes from the remote repository into my local branch before 
pushing.
Saved the changes and exited the vi interface by typing :wq and pressing Enter.
Committed the resolution with the command: git commit -m "Comment on how you fixed the merge conflict.".
Then I pushesd the correct README.md file merge for the main and readme branches.

Three Changes Made in Part C:
In Step C, three changes were made to different files. The changes were performed as follows:

Opened an HTML file in Visual Studio Code and added a comment <!-- Comment example --> to the file. I used Git commands to stage and commit the 
changes for each file. Then I ran git status to check the modified file (e.g., filename.html). Staged the changes with git add filename.html. 
Committed the changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "A comment describing the changes made.".
